Sometimes when copying text from different sources and pasting it into a website's backoffice you can end up with a strange char like this that looks like the normal space char but browsers render it as a non-breaking space (nbsp). 

This char might cause strange behavior on some devices, such as sticking two words together on an Android powered smartphone. 

The reasons why it appears and the consequences can vary, this tool right here is ment to help you find it on your page so you can do something about it.. because you can't really see it, it's invisible! :-)

Run it online at http://tools.heavydots.com/nbsp-space-char-detect or clone it and run it locally.
